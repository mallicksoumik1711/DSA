the pattern is 
binary subarray could be solved with prefix sum and hashmap
but with sliding window most of the question with 

"Subarrays with k - maximum/minimum/longest/least"

problems are solved

pattern is -> Exact(k) = Subarray (<=k) - subarray (<k)

most of the problems are solved via this method. Idk what is it called though
1. Binary subarray with 
2. Count number of nice subarrays
